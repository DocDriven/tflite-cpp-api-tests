# tflite-cpp-api-tests

Usage

The simple_ae.* files are an example for an autoencoder of size [90, 40, 10, 40, 90]. The Python script produces the tflite model. Through the usage of the visualize.py script, the model can be expected as html.

The vae files contain a more complex model of an variational autoencoder. Only the model and the visualization are provided.
